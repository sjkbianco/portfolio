summary: The Florida State EIT Consortium provides support, education, and advocacy to institutions of higher education throughout the state of Florida. The presenters will share the process of developing the consortium and its goals, and will utilize group exercises to guide participants with developing a collaborative EIT consortium.
abstract: "In 2018, three employees of the Florida State College system met at a conference and discussed issues surrounding EIT accessibility. From this conversation, a grass roots consortium was developed that has grown into a state-wide collaborative group, affiliated with Florida AHEAD, that provides virtual state-wide meetings, training, and support throughout the state. The presenters will share the blueprint utilized to form the consortium and discuss its ongoing goals, which include fostering state-wide collaborations, establishing technical standards, lobbying, and professional development opportunities. The presenters will facilitate interactive group exercises throughout the session to assist with developing a collaborative EIT consortium."
