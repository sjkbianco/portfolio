summary: Florida SouthWestern State College (FSW) continually works towards meeting and exceeding the level of access to all students, faculty, and staff to promote equity, diversity, and inclusion within the College. Active relationships and frequent faculty and staff training efforts ensure collaboration and expert guidance throughout the College.
abstract: "Since 2018, FSW began promoting a culture of access through active collaboration between the Library, Academic Schools, Academic Advising, ADAptive Services, Student Engagement, The Learning Center, General Counsel, eLearning, Facilities, & other areas. This cultural change has led to efficiencies in employee & student referrals for assistance through the Early Alert system, provision of accommodations, & the push for Universal Design for Learning & for the College's online presence with courses & public-facing website content. Notably, the deep partnerships between the Office of ADAptive Services & the Office of Information Technology helped to bolster College-Wide accessibility efforts to provide faculty & staff training opportunities for accessible design, along with the inclusion of the DEV 101 Online Certification Process for course development to include instructional designers, accessibility specialists, & librarians in the process to design accessible master online courses."
