> With so many professional learning opportunities within the instructional technology field available, it can sometimes be a daunting task to keep track. Try some of these comprehensive opportunities to stay current.

Professional development through your workplace is always an ideal track to take to keep current with pedagogical practices and the potential of new technology tools adopted by the institution. However, many of these opportunities may not exist for smaller instructional design teams or institutions with limited online course offerings. Fortunately, instructional technology does not lack free professional development opportunities and the ability to connect with other professionals.

## Feedback

At the time of writing, my only teaching experience is within the informal setting facilitating workshops. I facilitate the Universal Design and Access (UDA) intensive three-hour live online workshop and the Accessibility Tech Tuesday series of workshops. The Accessibility Tech Tuesday sessions are 45-minutes on particular topics related to course development and preparation. Below are some testimonials or comments from past participants of the Universal Design and Access workshop.

> The UDL presentation was the best workshop I have ever attended; I recommend it to everyone.

> I loved the accessibility and QM workshops! They were necessary in my opinion. I could not have completed the course design process without them!

> I enjoyed attending the Universal Design and Access Workshop. Steve did a great job presenting a complex topic and breaking it down so that anyone can understand it. He was also able to host an interactive class via zoom.

> Wow! What a great course with Steven.  I have to admit, accessibility information overwhelms me (I felt even more anxiety in the APPQMR module that addressed accessibility), but as I began to practice making documents accessible and inspecting them for accessibility I started to see that the process of making things accessible isn't as challenging as I originally thought it would be. By no stretch of the imagination do I feel like an expert, but I feel more confident about Universal Design and Accessibility, and frankly, I feel more compassionate toward learners who are challenged in ways that many others are not. I now clearly see the difference between making accommodations and simply making a course accessible.
