> Diverse learners can utilize free tools provided by Microsoft to enhance their online learning experience through creative presentations and media-rich note-taking.

Microsoft provides a variety of productivity software solutions for use within the private and public industry and education. Many of their web-based software applications are available for free with a Microsoft account. In terms of the online learning environment, two of their applications allow for flexibility of expression and encourage collaboration. These two programs are Microsoft Sway, a web-based presentation or newsletter creation tool, and OneNote, an electronic note-taking application.

## Microsoft Sway

Sway allows instructors and learners to rapidly create visually appealing presentations from searching a topic, uploading an existing PDF, Word, or PowerPoint file, and converting it into a mobile-friendly presentation. Users may also start blank Sway or select a template. Adding images and videos within Sway is easy. Users choose the content type to add, and the application will provide a search panel limited to open licensed content. Search suggestions are available from keywords within the Sway. The colors, layouts, amount of animation, and themes are all easily customizable.

Once the user finishes their Sway, they can embed it into any online platform with the capability to support iframes. Users may also share via a direct link to select individuals or make the link public. Viewers of the presentation have the option to download the Sway as a PDF or Word Document. There is also an accessibility view that removes animations, provides higher contrast colors, underlines links, and shows alternative text for images. Responsive design is also built-in to offer an excellent viewing experience regardless of screen size or the type of device. The responsive presentation of the content allows individuals with limited technology to access the content. The individual only needs access to an internet connection and a browser.

Both factors of responsive presentation and the ability to download an alternative format allow for individual choice in how they access the content allowing for audience diversity. Please review the [related article on Sway](/post/sway/) for additional considerations and a more in-depth review.

## OneNote

OneNote by Microsoft is a digital notebook application with features to clip webpages, record and transcribe audio, embed audio and videos, link to and insert files. Users can also draw or ink handwriting and mathematics and have contents read aloud via text-to-speech or by utilizing Immersive Reader. The notebook is essentially unlimited in that there are no limits on page sizes, page area, the number of sections, the number of notes, and the number of notebooks. The only limiting factor is the amount of OneDrive cloud storage available for a user account. It is best to create the notebook files within OneDrive. Storing the notebook in OneDrive allows accessing the contents from a web browser, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and installed apps on Windows and Mac. The fullest experience is available within the web browser and on Windows or Mac. The mobile apps have basic functionality to view, edit, and create pages.

At the heart of the OneNote application is allowing users to search for content within pages, sections, and notebooks. OneNote performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on all images and printouts within notes pages. The search locates all other text contents such as audio transcriptions and inked handwriting within results. The web version of OneNote can convert links into embedded content on the page. The link to embed feature makes it is easy to add a Microsoft Form, YouTube video, and other online interactive tools and media. Because OneNote allows multiple input options, it is ideal for creating media-rich notes and collaborative lesson materials. Class Notebook provides instructors the ability to assign pages to learners and see real-time interaction with the content.

OneNote pages can indeed provide an environment for [multiple means of representation](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/representation) and [multiple means of action and expression](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/action-expression) for learners. Please review the related article on OneNote for additional considerations and a more in-depth review.

## Summary

The example tools, Sway and OneNote, can provide an inclusive learning experience due to the availability of the free options of the applications. Many educational institutions already subscribe to Office 365 for education and provide cloud storage to learners. Each application has built-in accessibility and inclusive learning tools to allow all users to convert the content to a preferred format or express their learning in their way. OneNote, for instance, is the best tool for creating graphic organizers. By allowing users to clip web content, add rich media, annotate audio or video recordings, or inking over the content. Both apps provide the ability to collaborate in real-time through the web version.

The only factor that would limit the engagement with the real-time tools would be internet connectivity. Pickett (2021) notes, "[w]hen districts moved into emergency remote learning environments during the COVID-19 pandemic, they immediately recognized various inequities within their technology systems. The word "access" was used to describe the availability of devices, Internet connectivity, and learning materials. District technology leaders scrambled to establish equity of access to get devices and the Internet into the hands and homes of teachers and students." While the article talks about using assistive and accessible technologies, a factor within our diverse population is high-speed internet connections to families with lower incomes and those who live in rural areas. During the pandemic, many options to access the internet became available. However, internet access can still pose a barrier.
