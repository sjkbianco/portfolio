* At least two digital tools or web-based apps are provided as examples of how the technology can be used to meet diverse learner needs.

Microsoft provides a variety of productivity software solutions for use within private and public industry as well as education. Many of their web-based software applications are available for free with a Microsoft account. In terms of the online learning environment, two of their applications allow for flexibility of expression and can encourage collaboration. These two programs are Microsoft Sway, a web-based presentation or newsletter creation tool and OneNote, an electronic note taking application.

## Microsoft Sway

Sway allows for instructors and learners to rapidly create visually appealing presentations from searching a topic, uploading an existing PDF, Word, or PowerPoint file and converts it into a mobile-friendly presentation. Users may also start blank Sway or select a template. Adding images and videos within Sway is easy, by selecting the content type to add, the application will provide a search panel limited to open licensed content to use and also pulls keywords from the text within the Sway. The colors, layouts, amount of animation, and themes are all easily customizable.

Once the user finishes their Sway the are able to embed it into any online platform with the capability to support iframes, can share a direct link to select individuals, or make the link public. Viewers of the presentation have the option to download the Sway as a PDF or Word Document, there is also an accessibility view that removes animations, provides higher contrast colors, underlines links, and shows alternative text for images. Responsive design is also built-in to provide an excellent viewing experience regardless of screen size or the type of device. The responsive presentation of the content allows individuals with limited technology to access the content. The individual only needs access to an internet connection and a browser.

Both factors of responsive presentation and the ability to download an alternative format allow for individual choice in how they access the content allowing for audience diversity. Please review the related article on Sway for additional considerations and a more in-depth review.

## OneNote

OneNote by Microsoft is a digital notebook application with features to clip webpages, record and transcribe audio, embed videos, embed audio, link to and insert files, draw or ink handwriting and mathematics, and have contents read aloud via text-to-speech or by utilizing Immersive Reader. The notebook is essentially unlimited in that there are no limits on page sizes, page area, the amount of sections, the amount of notes, and the amount of notebooks. The only limiting factor is the amount of OneDrive cloud storage available for a user account. To take full advantage of OneNote, it is best to create the notebook files within OneDrive, this allows the ability to access the contents from a web browser, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and installed apps on Windows and Mac. The fullest experience is available within the web browser and on Windows or Mac. The mobile apps have basic functionality to view, edit, and create pages.

At the heart of the OneNote application is the ability to allow users to search for content within pages, sections, and notebooks. OneNote performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on all images and printouts within notes pages. All other text content such as audio transcriptions and inked handwriting are also found within search results. The web version of OneNote will also convert links into embedded content on the page, so it is easy to add a Microsoft Form, YouTube video, and other online interactive tools and media. Because OneNote allows for multiple input options it is an ideal tool to create media rich notes and collaborative lesson materials. Class Notebook provides instructors the ability to assign pages to learners and see realtime interaction with the content.

OneNote pages can truly provide an environment for [multiple means of representation](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/representation) and [multiple means of action and expression](https://udlguidelines.cast.org/action-expression) for learners. Please review the related article on OneNote for additional considerations and a more in-depth review.
