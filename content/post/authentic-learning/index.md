### Review: Education Technology: Distraction or Attraction? Changing Views.

Hello, this is Steven Bianco, and welcome to my EdTech podcast. For this episode, I listened to Education Technology: Distraction or Attraction? Changing Views, hosted by Tom Whitby and Nancy Blair interviewing their guest Katrina Spicer-Lindquist. Katrina was speaking about her experiences of integrating technology in her rural Western Massachusetts day and boarding school. While Katrina was making strides in integrating an Apple TV paired with iPads in her classroom and successfully flipping her ninth-grade history class, many of the other faculty were not yet on board with deep integration of technology within their classroom settings. The three discussed the issues for the hesitation in adopting technology. Tom pointed out that education as an institution is very conservative and slow to change. Nancy mentioned that many educators might want tight control over their students and classrooms. Finally, Katrina mentioned that it is possible that there is a fear of the unknown.

In listening to these opinions, I can agree. Katrina mentioned that technology requires a fair amount of front-loading to integrate into lessons and classroom settings. When technology is not engrained within the curriculum, it has the potential of being a distraction. We will make mistakes within our technology integrations, we are human, but we must be mindful that our students are going to be accessing technology that is presently inconceivable and in jobs that do not yet exist. We must teach students to be excited and agile with technology and learn how to learn. This is an essential skill to remain relevant in the future workplace. Employers will be more apt to hire someone with the drive to self-teach while also thinking outside of the box. In my workshops and training opportunities, I try to highlight the capabilities of software solutions. However, I also show that I do not know everything, but I am willing to learn with them one-on-one.

Overall, we must be willing to loosen our grip and embrace the changes technology brings. While we must consider the privacy, security, and accessibility of our tech and apps there is room to learn, we do not need to be experts. Thank you for listening.
