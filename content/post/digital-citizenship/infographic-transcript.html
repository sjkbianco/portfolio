    	<h1>Digital Citizenship Matters</h1>
	<p>Steven Bianco</p>
	<p>Every FSW Student, Employee, Professor, and Administrator has an important part in Digital Citizenship to promote a respectful, informed, and collegial environment.</p>
	<h2>Stay Secure</h2>
	<h3>Lock Down Your Account</h3>
	<p>Strong passwords have eight or more characters, including numbers, upper- &amp; lower-case letters, &amp; special characters. To create a strong password, consider using a phrase you can remember. FSW will never ask you to send your password.</p>
	<h2>Stay Civil</h2>
	<h3>Communicate with Courtesy</h3>
	<p>We are all learning together! Remember, we are all humans deserving respect &amp; civility. Be kind, even if you may disagree with another&#39;s perspective. Ask respectful questions to understand their perspective.</p>
	<h2>Stay Professional</h2>
	<h3>Convey Your Personal Brand</h3>
	<p>There are so many ways to communicate with others online, but this also makes sharing very easy. Brand yourself by posting content you are comfortable sharing with the world &amp; convey how you wish everyone to view you.</p>
	<h2>Stay Informed</h2>
	<h3>Critically Evaluate Information</h3>
	<p>It is vital to evaluate the information you find on the web, social media, &amp; the news. Watch out for biases, misinformation, &amp; filter bubbles. Seek credible information, opposing viewpoints, &amp; research to stay informed.</p>
	<h2>Stay Honest</h2>
	<h3>Cite Sources &amp; Respect Authors</h3>
	<p>Copyright and academic dishonesty are serious issues. Consider using openly licensed resources. For more information, consult with a Librarian or the Writing Center to help you locate &amp; cite copyrighted &amp; openly licensed content.</p>
