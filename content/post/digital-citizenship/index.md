Digital citizenship is a topic traditionally taught within the K-12 curriculum. However, it is essential to reinforce within higher education as well as we face additional complexities. The subject of digital citizenship covers privacy, media balance, personal well-being, cyberbullying, communication, media literacy, digital footprint and identity, and copyright concerns. Each area of this complex subject is relevant for learners within the higher education environment. Within my professional practice, data security and privacy are the most appropriate due to FERPA and ensuring our student data and institutional infrastructure are safe from cyberattacks. No matter if they are a student, faculty, staff, or an administrator, each person has a role to play in keeping our resources secure through complex and challenging to guess passwords. However, in the cycle on digital citizenship, I learned that media literacy and copyright are also under this umbrella of digital citizenship. To outline the topics straightforwardly, I developed an infographic on the subject. While brief, the infographic has good considerations that highlight each area of digital citizenship in an easy-to-remember format. With the ever-evolving nature of the online environment, it is vital to keep up-to-date on the subject. The best way is to keep informed through the resources produced by [EDUCAUSE](https://www.educause.edu/), the [United States Department of Education](https://www.ed.gov/), and other organizations like [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) and [The American Library Association](https://www.ala.org/).
