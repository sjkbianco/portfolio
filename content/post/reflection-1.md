In January 2007, I began full-time employment with Florida SouthWestern State College Libraries, then the Edison College Library. My first project was to coordinate the move activities for the impending renovation of the facilities to a temporary location for 1.5 years. In 2009, after coordinating two moves the Library resides in the newly rennovated permanent location again.
