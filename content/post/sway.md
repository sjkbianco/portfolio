[Microsoft Sway](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/getting-started-with-sway-2076c468-63f4-4a89-ae5f-424796714a8a) is a cloud-based (within the browser) application for creating visually appealing reports, presentations, newsletters, and stories that are responsive to various screen sizes. Sway has a controlled set of elements but is also able to have interactive forms included. Sections within a Sway are available in the storyline. While it does not accommodate branched situations, it is very well-suited to create accessible presentations for online courses. Please checkout the [Sway Presentation Discussion Boards](https://sway.office.com/gmoUdWQdbcH2nNmF?ref=Link) made for an assignment in Universal Design for Learning.

## Sway Pros

Sway presentations easily embed within LMS pages, a link for the Sway can be shared for viewing or collaboration, the design of Sway helps reduce text-heavy slides of information making the focus more on the lecture content. Sway is very easy to use and rapidly create a visually appealing screen-responsive presentation. Creative Commons image search is embedded to add images very easily as a title background or within the content. Users can also upload a Word Document, PDF, or PowerPoint to automatically create a Sway skeleton of the content. Users can also just type a topic and Sway will grab relevant information from Wikipedia to begin a new Sway.

## Sway Cons

Microsoft Sway does not offer a feature to include audio narration, however, audio can be recorded and hosted on Microsoft Stream or YouTube and embedded as a part of the section. Sway does not support the embed of data tables to demonstrate data relationships, however, there is a “card stack” feature where images or text card groups can present relationships in short visual or textual chunks. These cons relate to features commonly available within other authoring tools and would require an adjustment in authoring practices and how content is arranged.

## Suggestions

The main suggestion on the use of Sway is to keep it simple, design light but for impact. Do not use too much text, try to chunk information into bullet points. Look at the text block settings to make text larger. Select large images for backgrounds to avoid pixelation and then use the "focus points" tool to show off the important aspect of the image.

## Cautions on use

Because of the simplicity of Sway it may not be the best for more complex presentation formats. Although this format is made for interactivity, it is limited. Sway has the potential of being depreciated by Microsoft, depreciation is a frequent occurance for online hosted technology tools so it is best to keep backup copies of each Sway. However, if many users activly use the product the likelihood of depreciation is low. Sway allows for export of the content in Word or PDF, I recommend using the Word version as the backup copy for future editing and the ability to import content into other office applications should it be depreciated.
