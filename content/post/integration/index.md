## The Technology Integration Matrix

[![The Technology Integration Matrix with descriptions. External website opens in new tab.](/post/integration/2019LevelsCharSlideWide.jpg)](https://fcit.usf.edu/matrix/matrix/)

The Technology Integration Matrix (TIM) is a framework developed by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology at the University of South Florida. The goal of the TIM is to provide a "common vocabulary for pedagogically sound technology integration for teachers, school leaders, coaches, researchers, evaluators, and professional development facilitators" (Florida Center for Instructional Technology, n.d.). Development work began on the TIM in 2003. The current version of the matrix is the third edition developed in 2019. While the focus of the TIM videos and related training content is within the K-12 education domain, the framework can work for higher education.

There are five interdependent characteristics of meaningful learning environments: active, collaborative, constructive, authentic, and goal-directed. These characteristics are associated with five levels of technology integration: entry, adoption, adaptation, infusion, and transformation. Each intersection of attributes of meaningful learning environments and levels of technology integration provides descriptors in how technology is integrated and as an evaluative benchmark. Each of the twenty-five intersections displays varied technological integration for in-person, blended, and online courses. There is no wrong or correct position within the framework, as different lessons and activities require various levels of technology.

Application of the TIM within the online learning environment for authentic learning would most likely best serve learners in the adaptation, infusion, or transformation levels. These require less instructor guidance and more learner-centric engagement with technology tools.

## Authentic Learning with Technology

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe allowFullScreen="allowFullScreen" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SFxUFMBGgG8?ecver=1&amp;cc_load_policy=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;yt:stretch=16:9&amp;autohide=1&amp;" class="embed-responsive-item" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

As demonstrated in The HELIX Classroom video (Harvard Extension School, 2020), many learners can join the in-person classroom experience using online conferencing tools with the proper audio/video equipment. The online student experience is streamlined, seeing the presentation and a camera angle showing in-person learners responding to questions and the instructor. The instructor and in-classroom learners have monitors to view the online students. The instructor calls the learners by name and does not recognize or point out the student is online or in-person. The instructor asks follow-up questions to the entire class to improve or add to the comments of the original learner's response. The authentic aspect of this environment is the real-time and thoughtful collaboration of the learners.

Applying the video to the Technology Integration Matrix, the definition of authentic learning is "using technology to link learning activities to the world beyond the instructional setting. This characteristic focuses on the extent to which technology is used to place learning into a meaningful context, increase its relevance to the learner, and tap into students' intrinsic motivation" (Florida Center for Instructional Technology, 2019). The other dimension of this analysis places the classroom setting at the adaption level. Technology integration provides some choice and exploration where learners have become comfortable using the technology.

## Learner Voice and Choice

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9"><iframe allowFullScreen="allowFullScreen" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2n7EelMbzG0?ecver=1&amp;cc_load_policy=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;yt:stretch=16:9&amp;autohide=1&amp;" class="embed-responsive-item" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

The methodology of the genius hour (Spencer, 2017) allows for student voice and choice in their "20% time" in class. During this time, the students can learn what they want or choose their topic to research. The students have the choice to work alone or in groups. While working on their research, they will create their resources, activities, self-assessment, and deadlines. The final deliverable is an artifact or product the learner(s) will share with the world. Genius hour promotes self-directed learning, creativity, critical thinking, and ownership of their educational experience.

While this video does not show the use of technology in action within a learning environment, the methodology can apply to an online setting. For example, with groups in the Learning Management System, if the learner informs the instructor of the individuals they will be working with, the instructor can then create a group. The group is then available for the learners to access, make discussion boards, announcements, and post files. Learners can make use of online collaboration software to meet based on the goals and schedule they devise. For this online collaboration, learners can decide which online platform to share their final artifact. While there is no set deadline to use the time during the semester, the final submission should two weeks before the end of the semester. There should be a dropbox available for the learner(s) to submit a link to the final artifact.

## The Four C's of 21<sup>st</sup> Century Learning

The four C's of 21<sup>st</sup> century learning are communication, collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving, and creativity and innovation. These four C's are at the top of the framework for 21<sup>st</sup> century learning under the classification of learning and innovation skills. Also included within the top arc of the framework are Life and Career Skills and Information, Media, and Technology Skills. These three significant arc segments revolve around the Key Subjects, including the three Rs and 21st Century Themes.

### The four C's Defined

1. Creativity and innovation - individuals use brainstorming and idea-creation techniques to create new concepts and ideas to refine further and evaluate before opening them up for further feedback from peers. After the refined idea has further refined from the feedback, individuals can work with groups to develop a final tangible and valuable contribution to the field.
2. Critical thinking and problem solving - learners analyze, make judgments, make decisions through various types of reasoning as appropriate to the situation, and make connections through synthesizing and interpreting information.
3. Communication -  articulate ideas effectively using oral, written, and nonverbal communication skills and listen effectively to decipher context, meaning, and intention.
4. Collaboration - the learners demonstrate the ability to work effectively and respectfully with diverse teams and assume shared responsibility for collaborative work.

### The Importance when Integrating Technology

Information, media, and technology skills are another component of the four C's. Learners must utilize critical thinking and problem solving to access and evaluate information and use and manage that information effectively. They must also effectively analyze and create media while applying their technical skills. Because technology changes rapidly, learners must be able to adapt to change and be flexible. It is vital that students "learn to learn" to stay current with technology innovation and effectively operate it.

It is best to utilize collaboration technologies that have remained current over the last three to five years. Because collaboration is an essential component of the four C's, providing a familiar platform with the necessary tools will lead to better performance in receiving peer feedback and connecting with others.
