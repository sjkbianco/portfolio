## Technology Impacts

## Technology Impacts

There are multiple integration frameworks available to review media, technology, and other educational materials within the online environment. Each of these frameworks provides a rubric or analytical lens to view specific aspects of implementation or integration. Concerning evaluation, it is a process to perform before, during, and after. It is also helpful to involve learners in the process, if at all possible. Some directions on the evaluation of technology within the online learning environment are available through the [Rubric for eLearning Tool Evaluation](https://teaching.uwo.ca/pdf/elearning/Rubric-for-eLearning-Tool-Evaluation.pdf) by Anstey & Watson (2018) and [The Technology Integration Matrix](https://fcit.usf.edu/matrix) by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology at the University of South Florida.

The rubric developed by Anstey & Watson (2018) examines aspects of functionality, accessibility, technical, mobile design, privacy, data protection and rights, social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence. While in contrast, The Technology Integration Matrix evaluates the level of engagement and implementation of the technology's use. Taking the topic of evaluation further, we should also consider [Mayer's twelve principles of multimedia (DeBell, 2019)](https://waterbearlearning.com/mayers-principles-multimedia-learning/).

Consider as many evaluation points or your preferred rubrics for assessment while also requesting feedback from your stakeholders. For example, let's consider adding a video player on a content page within an online course. It is a straightforward piece of content to embed, and many video hosting websites provide an easy-to-copy and paste embed code. But simply evaluating for accessibility can provide usability factors.

* The video should not auto-play
* The video controls should always be present
* Accurate captions are available for the video
* The video player is keyboard accessible
* Does the video player offer audio description as an audio option?
* Can the user view the video on full-screen?
* The video does not provide rapid flashing

The above is one set of factors to consider for one type of media, video, for implementation into a lesson page.

* A description of how a specific technology impacts a lesson or learning activity.
* A hyperlink to an example of the technology being used to impact a learning activity is included with a reflection of its importance to the learning objectives.
* A reflection of how the technology can be evaluated to ensure its effectiveness.
