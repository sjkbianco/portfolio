> Evaluation and implementation are essential pieces of the puzzle for engaging learning experiences. Alignment of both aspects will allow for the intentional use of selected materials.

## Technology Impacts

There are multiple integration frameworks available to review media, technology, and other educational materials within the online environment. Each of these frameworks provides a rubric or analytical lens to view specific aspects of implementation or integration. Concerning evaluation, it is a process to perform before, during, and after. It is also helpful to involve learners in the process, if at all possible. Some directions on the evaluation of technology within the online learning environment are available through the [Rubric for eLearning Tool Evaluation](https://teaching.uwo.ca/pdf/elearning/Rubric-for-eLearning-Tool-Evaluation.pdf) by Anstey & Watson (2018) and [The Technology Integration Matrix](https://fcit.usf.edu/matrix) by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology at the University of South Florida.

The rubric developed by Anstey & Watson (2018) examines aspects of functionality, accessibility, technical, mobile design, privacy, data protection and rights, social presence, teaching presence, and cognitive presence. While in contrast, The Technology Integration Matrix evaluates the level of engagement and implementation of the technology's use. Taking the topic of evaluation further, we should also consider [Mayer's twelve principles of multimedia (DeBell, 2019)](https://waterbearlearning.com/mayers-principles-multimedia-learning/) when including multimedia to online learning.

Consider as many evaluation points or your preferred rubrics for assessment while also requesting feedback from your stakeholders. For example, let's consider adding a video player on a content page within an online course. It is a straightforward piece of content to embed, and many video hosting websites provide an easy-to-copy and paste embed code. But simply evaluating for accessibility can provide usability factors.

* The video should not auto-play
* The video controls should always be present
* Accurate captions are available for the video
* The video player is keyboard accessible
* Does the video player offer audio description as an audio option?
* Can the user view the video on full-screen?
* The video does not provide rapid flashing

The above is one set of factors to consider for one type of media, video, for implementation into a lesson page. The difference is some learners accessing the video or all learners accessing the video.

## Example Expanded

Let's take the video example further by using YouTube. YouTube is one of the most popular video hosting services available, and users can find content on virtually any topic. The video player for YouTube is keyboard accessible. However, not all videos provide accurate captioning, and it can also be challenging to contact the content creator to request or deliver accurate captions for upload. Many educational institutions will partner with a captioning provider to ensure accurate captions and have a video player service integrated with the Learning Management System. It is possible to embed a YouTube video within a content page with accurate captions utilizing these two services. If your institution does not offer this capability, [Amara](https://amara.org/) may be a suitable option. Amara is a free platform to caption and translate video captions for YouTube videos. Each video on Amara has a unique link to provide on the content page. It may not be possible to directly embed the video within a content page with script sanitizing. However, linking out to the accurately captioned video opens access to all, and there are many community volunteers to provide translations to other languages.

While there is not an example lesson here, many courses utilize video to supplement and enhance course content to provide an alternative form of access to the information. Some videos give the entire lecture for a course module. The learning objectives that apply may be recalling, listing, describing, explaining, or other Bloom's taxonomy verbs to have learners provide a measurable learning outcome from viewing the video.

For an example video, we will provide the [YouTube Algorithms: How to Avoid the Rabbit Hole | Above the Noise](https://florida.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/youtube-algorithms-above-the-noise/youtube-algorithms-above-the-noise/) video with ISTE learning outcome 4.a "Students: know and use a deliberate design process for generating ideas, testing theories, creating innovative artifacts or solving authentic problems."

<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9 mb-3 mt-3"><iframe allowFullScreen="allowFullScreen" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CuFKYSSZtpo?ecver=1&amp;cc_load_policy=1&amp;iv_load_policy=3&amp;yt:stretch=16:9&amp;autohide=1&amp;" class="embed-responsive-item" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0"></iframe></div>

We can see the video player is keyboard accessible, the video does not autoplay, there are accurate captions, and users can easily make the video play in full-screen. After we have established those criteria are met. We can further review the media against the overall content of the lesson, ensure the video is embedded consistent with local design standards, and align both the video and content to the overall learning objectives for the course, module, and lesson.

## Personal Analysis

Evaluating YouTube content through the [Rubric for eLearning Tool Evaluation](https://teaching.uwo.ca/pdf/elearning/Rubric-for-eLearning-Tool-Evaluation.pdf) by Anstey & Watson (2018) results in the following:

Evaluating YouTube content through [The Technology Integration Matrix](https://fcit.usf.edu/matrix) by the Florida Center for Instructional Technology at the University of South Florida depends upon the degree to which the technology is integrated or implemented in the classroom. Simply providing a video on a page for a learner to view for information would result in an **"active learning, entry level"** where information is passively received. The extended descriptors from the matrix are as follows:

* **Students.** Students receive information from the teacher or from other sources. Students may be watching an instructional video on a website or using a computer program for drill and practice activities.
* **Teacher.** The teacher may be the only one actively using technology. This may include using presentation software to support delivery of a lecture. The teacher may also have the students complete drill and practice activities on computers to practice basic skills, such as typing.
* **Setting.** The setting is arranged for direct instruction and individual work. Any student access to technology resources is limited and highly regulated.

I agree, depending upon the content and classroom context. Students can use YouTube videos to share digital portfolio content, present their ideas, and promote twenty-first-century skills. The primary basis of evaluation is on the posting of YouTube videos within LMS content. The Technology Integration Matrix provides other levels of engagement and levels of adoption.
