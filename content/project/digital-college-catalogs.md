Beginning July 2011, to better provide open access to past college catalogs and create a partnership through LYRASIS with the Internet Archive, I collected and organized past physical issues of the college catalog from 1962 to present and prepared them for digitization through the Internet Archive for permanent online hosting.

**Project Page:** [Florida SouthWestern State College's Internet Archive Homepage](https://archive.org/details/fswlibraries). The College's Registrar added the archived versions to their [College Catalog Homepage](https://www.fsw.edu/academics/catalog) and periodically provides PDF copies of the catalog for posting on the project page.
