In September 2017 FSW Library Services decided to upgrade the existing LibGuides (CMS) to version 2.0 to provide a more responsive web platform for mobile devices as well as complying with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) web guidelines for accessibility. I was tasked to assist with the asset transfer/conversion between the versions and also provide an accessible color palette that was both visually appealing and readable by all patrons. In researching ways to best comply with the [contrast requirements within WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0#qr-contrast-enhanced), I came across the [accessibility color wheel tool](https://gmazzocato.altervista.org/colorwheel/wheel.php) that checks color choices against the WCAG 2.0 recommended contrast ratios. Another unique feature of this tool displays how the color choices would appear for persons with no color insensitivity, [deuteranopia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/conditions/C0155016/), [protanopia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/conditions/C0155015/), and [tritanopia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/conditions/C0155017/). The example shown below is a screenshot taken from the [Library's Tech FAQs LibGuide](http://researchguides.fsw.edu/TechFAQs) I had actively contributed content to utilizing the global color defaults I selected with the aid of the referenced web tool.

Besides working with WCAG guidelines for our web-based services in my current position William Shuluk, Coordinator of Library Services/Head Librarian initiated a project in December, 2017 to provide a more robust and state-of-the-art computing area within the library division-wide for patrons with various disabilities primarily with visual impairments and desktop height limitations. The project began at the Thomas Edison (Lee) Campus with the purchase of four desks selected by Professor Timothy Bishop which have a built-in adjustable monitor/display arm, two of the desktops are motorized to provide comfortable sitting or standing access to Library computers, the other two desks are stationary and wheelchair accessible. My task was to coordinate with both FSW-IT and Adaptive Services to provide a technological plan, pending funding from the FSW Office of Adaptive Services. Through collaborating with Angela Hartsell, Director of Adaptive Services, the plan formulated one motorized and stationary desk be equipped with a flatbed scanner and an Intel NUC loaded with the newest [Kurzweil](https://www.kurzweiledu.com/about-kurzweil/text-to-speech.html) Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to simulated computer voice software. The other stationary desk would utilize a [DaVinci HD/OCR magnifying device](https://www.enhancedvision.com/low-vision-product-line/davinci-all-in-one-hd-video-magnifier-with-text-to-speech.html) and a secondary widescreen display for computing. The second motorized desktop would have a standard library lab computer profile to provide patrons without the need for visual enhancement devices a flexible work-space. Project completion for the Thomas Edison (Lee) Campus - Rush Library is expected by July 31, 2018.
