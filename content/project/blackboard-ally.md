Florida SouthWestern State College began exploing the possibility of integrating Blackboard Ally into the Canvas Learning Management System in October 2018. After having demonstrations presented to the Accessibility Working Committee and eLearning Faculty leads the reception was positive in adopting the platform to perform Institution and Course-level accessibility checking reports for course content and including uploaded files. In April 2020, Blackboard Ally was adopted and began implementation into the Learning Management system. As project manager we started to develop training resources and allow early-access to the tool for faculty who opted-in. The full roll-out is anticipated for the 2021-2022 academic year.
