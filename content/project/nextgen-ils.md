In January 2014, Florida Virtual Campus began the selection process for a Next Generation Integrated Library System to replace the current automation system for all State of Florida public colleges and universities. My participation in the project was a metadata and description reviewer of the vendor's products and to be a liaison for Florida SouthWestern State College.
